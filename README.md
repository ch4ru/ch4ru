## Hey, I'm Charu! 👋

I'm a third-year B.Tech student from India, passionate about crafting impactful AI solutions that solve real-world problems with creativity. Three years ago, I started my tech journey in web development, building dynamic interfaces and learning the ropes of coding. But when I discovered AI and ML, I found my true calling—a field where my creativity could power innovative solutions to real-world challenges. From classical machine learning to large language models (LLMs) and now agentic AI, my journey reflects a relentless pursuit of building scalable, intelligent systems.

My GitHub showcases my growth from exploratory projects to production-ready AI pipelines, and I’m eager to contribute to internships or collaborations in AI/ML, MLOps, or agentic workflows.


## 🔍 Current Focus

I’m diving into agentic AI—systems that autonomously reason, plan, and execute tasks—while strengthening my MLOps expertise to deploy models at scale. My current pursuits include:





- Exploring frameworks like LangChain and AutoGen for building autonomous AI agents.



- Mastering AWS SageMaker, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines for production-ready ML systems.



- Studying cloud orchestration to ensure robust, scalable AI architectures.



- Experimenting with LLM fine-tuning and prompt engineering for creative, real-world applications.

## 🧰 Skills & Tools





- Machine Learning & Deep Learning: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers, Sentence Transformers



- MLOps & Deployment: AWS (SageMaker, EC2), Docker, Flask, CI/CD pipelines



- Data Engineering: Elasticsearch, Pandas, NumPy



- Programming: Python, SQL, C++ , JavaScript (basic)



- Other: Git, Linux, Jupyter Notebooks, Markdown


## 📬 Get In Touch

I’m excited to collaborate on AI/ML, MLOps, or agentic AI projects through internships, research, or open-source work. Let’s build systems that make a difference!
