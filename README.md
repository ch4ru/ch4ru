## Hey, I'm Charu! üëã

I'm a third-year B.Tech student from India, passionate about crafting impactful AI solutions that solve real-world problems with creativity. Three years ago, I started my tech journey in web development, building dynamic interfaces and learning the ropes of coding. But when I discovered AI and ML, I found my true calling‚Äîa field where my creativity could power innovative solutions to real-world challenges. From classical machine learning to large language models (LLMs) and now agentic AI, my journey reflects a relentless pursuit of building scalable, intelligent systems.

My GitHub showcases my growth from exploratory projects to production-ready AI pipelines, and I‚Äôm eager to contribute to internships or collaborations in AI/ML, MLOps, or agentic workflows.

## üöÄ My Journey





2023: Began with web development, building responsive websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Discovered AI/ML and was hooked by its potential to solve real-world problems creatively.



2024: Dove into classical ML, starting with a digit classifier using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Explored TensorFlow and scikit-learn to tackle data-driven challenges.



2025: Transitioned to deep learning and recommendation systems, creating an eCommerce product recommendation engine. Embraced transformers with projects like fake news detection and fine-tuning LLaMA 2.



2025 (Now): Focused on MLOps and agentic AI, building scalable AI pipelines with AWS, CI/CD, and cloud orchestration. Exploring autonomous AI systems that reason, plan, and act to solve complex problems.


## üîç Current Focus

I‚Äôm diving into agentic AI‚Äîsystems that autonomously reason, plan, and execute tasks‚Äîwhile strengthening my MLOps expertise to deploy models at scale. My current pursuits include:





- Exploring frameworks like LangChain and AutoGen for building autonomous AI agents.



- Mastering AWS SageMaker, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines for production-ready ML systems.



- Studying cloud orchestration to ensure robust, scalable AI architectures.



- Experimenting with LLM fine-tuning and prompt engineering for creative, real-world applications.

## üß∞ Skills & Tools





- Machine Learning & Deep Learning: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers, Sentence Transformers



- MLOps & Deployment: AWS (SageMaker, EC2), Docker, Flask, CI/CD pipelines



- Data Engineering: Elasticsearch, Pandas, NumPy



- Programming: Python, SQL, C++ , JavaScript (basic)



- Other: Git, Linux, Jupyter Notebooks, Markdown


## üì¨ Get In Touch

I‚Äôm excited to collaborate on AI/ML, MLOps, or agentic AI projects through internships, research, or open-source work. Let‚Äôs build systems that make a difference!
